## Introduction to AWS Lambda
### What is AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service by Amazon. It lets you run code without you having to provision or manage servers. 

### How does it work?

+ The developer codes the lambda function and specifies the runtime environment. 
+ These functions can be triggered through preconfigured APIs, S3 Buckets, DynamoDB and various other methods.
+ Once a function is triggered, AWS runs it for you and you only pay for the number of miliseconds your function runs.
+ Job done, no servers - no hassle!

### Should I Lambda or should I not? [2]
+ **Why I should?**
    + Reduced time to market and quicker software release.
    + Lower operational and development costs.
    + A smaller cost to scale â€“ there is no need for developers to implement code to scale and administrators do not need to upgrade existing servers or add additional ones.
    + Works with agile development and allows developers to focus on code and to deliver faster.
    + Fits with microservices, which can be implemented as functions.
    + Reduces the complexity of software.
    + Simplifies packaging and deployment and requires no system administration.
+ **Why I shouldn't?**
    + Serverless is not efficient for long-running applications.
    + Vendor lock-in.
    + Introduces additional overhead for function/microservice calls.
    + In practice, it takes some time for a scalable serverless platform to handle a first request by your function.
    + No out-of-the-box tools to test functions locally.
